            Various kinds of work are carried out in Ireland in order to protect bird species.

               <strong>Research and monitoring</strong>
           </h2>
           <p>
                An essential part of bird conservation is monitoring and recording information about the species such as their numbers,
                breeding habits, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientific research may be carried out to determine whether a species is in decline and how to address the problem.

               <strong>Habitat protection</strong>
           </h2>
           <p>
               The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many birds and therefore protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
           </p>
           <p>
               One example of this is the preservation of wetlands in Ireland.

               <strong>Control invasive plants and animals</strong>
           </h2>
           <p>
               Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, for example by eating their eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rhododendron is an example of an invasive plant which can very quickly take over large areas of countryside, 
                disrupting the biodiversity.
